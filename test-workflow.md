## üóÑÔ∏è Database Structure

**MongoDB Database:** `tripapp_db`

**Collections:**
- `users` - Customer information
- `trips` - Trip bookings and status
- `payments` - Payment records

## üîç Status Flow

1. **Draft/Pending** ‚Üí Trip requested by customer
2. **Planned/Awaiting Payment** ‚Üí Approved by owner
3. **Booked/Confirmed** ‚Üí Payment completed
4. **Completed** ‚Üí Trip finished

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Backend Not Connecting to MongoDB
- Ensure MongoDB is running
- Check connection string in server.js
- Default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/tripapp_db`

### API Calls Failing
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check CORS settings in backend
- Frontend should be on port 3000

### Status Not Updating
- Clear browser cache
- Refresh page after actions
- Check browser console for errors

## üìù Key Files Modified
